{"de":"In the first short, Lowe Gear and the Junk Guild make a stop at an mobile suit parts auction on Earth where Lowe purchases a head taken from a modified BuCUE suit which, when attached to the arm of his Red Frame Astray, acts as a dual beam saber. Lowe tries to decrypt some combat data contained in the head, but is shortly engaged by, and goes into combat with, several ZAFT suits including a CGUE DEEP Arms. In the second short, Blue Frame pilot Gai Murakamo engages and, with the help of his fellow Serpent Tail mercenaries, traps a GINN High Mobility Type. He then faces off with the legendary Edward Harrelson, who pilots a Sword Calamity Gundam and has just finished destroying a fleet of ZAFT ships.\n\n(Source: ANN)","nm":"Mobile Suit Gundam SEED MSV Astray","jp":"Mobile Suit Gundam SEED MSV Astray","im":"https:\/\/img.bunnyccdn.co\/_r\/300x400\/100\/1b\/61\/1b619e429113183d2af584215312fafa\/1b619e429113183d2af584215312fafa.jpg","tp":"OVA","fi":"Finished Airing","rt":"6.36","tm":7,"dt":"Mar 1, 2004 to Jul 1, 2004","ge":["Mecha","Sci-Fi","Space","Military"],"st":["Sunrise"],"eps":{"1":{"i":[0,0,0,0],"f":"0e3e1a8deb9f10002e867ec6a7a74939db11e7498ce1eb8f5698832988c620848691c1b3c87ef0387afba4bc0f68d9e944c9364ad6a154f9f5e0b45225dbe0212623a2be3518e41aeb684e084f14422c6a7f703fcdb5ba5ede79190a67bdfdba6b51cc65325961351c51315913e63f6e","t":[["03\/a5\/03a5cd6474b315fccdb884d37f4718ff\/eng-2.vtt","English"]]},"2":{"i":[0,0,0,0],"f":"5f7bb05b591105983517fb2261fb6a69ef0522b16ca50ff753abd2da7f8869549912226d9d484f4b045e9b5da19f8fadb8881fa62ed39485142d76d64a919b7ca87e4ed1c99bb0fb6ea0d5c9714c0e21311aaf986517ce822eaccd180f076a190f93c919884468ab8acfa34a7c5c5cc2","t":[["6f\/7e\/6f7e58bbf67fc35ae6c5b9b09dcdfbe6\/eng-2.vtt","English"]]}}}
