{"de":"Based on the manga by U-Jin.\n\nThis is a story of two siblings, Anzu and Naruto Nozaki, heirs to the fabulous Nozaki fortune. Naruto appears to be an overbearing sis-con. In fact, he's madly in love with Anzu, because they're not blood-related. He confines her to the family mansion for \"security,\" depriving her of companionship and a real life. At age 16, she starts to rebel. She smuggles in a kitten as a pet (Naruto hates cats) and then escapes in a delivery truck. Naruto catches up to her and realizes that she can't be confined like a bird in a cage. He agrees to let have a normal life, but just then, tragedy strikes","nm":"Juliet","jp":"Juliet","im":"https:\/\/img.bunnyccdn.co\/_r\/300x400\/100\/c5\/9b\/c59b7f03e6609df5b3ea5ba0094bebc3\/c59b7f03e6609df5b3ea5ba0094bebc3.jpg","tp":"OVA","fi":"Finished Airing","rt":"5.07","tm":27,"dt":"Mar 25, 1999","ge":["Comedy","Supernatural"],"st":["Public & Basic","Ripple Film"],"eps":{"1":{"i":[0,0,0,0],"f":"cb690ddc44bc607c0a8d4ccf6bc4aefb37dae41d880aa9518a3c3769c813e01cca545b56627e4959b409f0ad4f18d1a27c0ad3ea9edb426679d252b94598284d6a5705fe858554dbc3cd8fb42c61148a52360c382b9e09cd80bf7f5626db1a4a7df23353dc05eb17c61411864c72624e","t":[["cf\/5a\/cf5a393f7f8b6ba5a041714da5b06258\/cf5a393f7f8b6ba5a041714da5b06258.vtt","English"]]}}}
