{"de":"After their world was saved by Gridman and Akane Shinjo returned to the real world, Y\u016bta, Rikka, and Utsumi return to their normal lives, though Y\u016bta still has to adjust to losing two months of his memories due to being possessed by Gridman during that time. Rikka and Utsumi work on writing a script for a play their class will perform in the upcoming school festival based on their experiences with Gridman, while Y\u016bta tries to work up the courage to confess his feelings to Rikka. However, their life is disrupted when a kaiju suddenly attacks the city. Y\u016bta voluntarily fuses with Gridman again to fight the kaiju, and is assisted by the return of the Neon Genesis Junior High Students, who now count a newly revived Gauma who commands DynaRex as their newest member. Gridman and the NGJHS defeat the kaiju, and explain that some unknown phenomenon is causing different universes to overlap in a potential Big Crunch.","nm":"Gridman Universe","jp":"Gridman Universe","im":"https:\/\/img.bunnyccdn.co\/_r\/300x400\/100\/91\/8c\/918c0b2549fac0cdd545a3f718fdab12\/918c0b2549fac0cdd545a3f718fdab12.jpg","tp":"Movie","fi":"Finished Airing","rt":"","tm":0,"dt":"Mar 24, 2023","ge":["Action","Mecha","Sci-Fi"],"st":["Trigger"],"eps":{"1":{"i":[0,0,0,0],"f":"6eee80f8c6428957a8ab5c50c013e4960daee34f4b6c8c39e589ed8f21dcd090c2ca6b60b03223d681ea3a342d684f1c4ba75d171988cbf07747e6bd2fe4c72b79d40ab9ece31d87df3d734330bdb467cbfc70c3e83327fdc40149b798bfc06b0855b30c5bb245a95ec0eda7b8ee4a9b1319b435a479282da11341329a20f59a","t":[["9e\/61\/9e615d066f84944d6992a2c5b6c5bd9e\/9e615d066f84944d6992a2c5b6c5bd9e.vtt","English"]]}}}
