After a morning meeting, Watanabe talks to Aoi and puts her in charge of a new theatrical anime project for the studio. The project has unexpected problems, and Aoi is unsure if the company can proceed with a theatrical anime with its current state of affairs. While dealing with that anxiety, Aoi meets a new colleague named Kaede Miyai (voiced by Ayane Sakura). She and the MusAni team work together to complete the project.","nm":"Shirobako Movie","jp":"Shirobako Movie","im":"https:\/\/img.bunnyccdn.co\/_r\/300x400\/100\/e9\/28\/e928d90de8c809206d2ad293b9b84f29\/e928d90de8c809206d2ad293b9b84f29.jpg","tp":"Movie","fi":"Finished Airing","rt":"7.45","tm":120,"dt":"Feb 29, 2020","ge":["Comedy","Drama"],"st":["P.A.
