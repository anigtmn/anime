Doraemon used a virtual video game console and let Nobita play \"Journey to The West\" to give Nobita clothes that the Monkey King wears. Nobita messed up on prooving Monkey king exists. When Nobita and his friends played \"Journey to The West\" and they finished the game without fighting any demons. Later, they found out thier world is ruled by demons.
