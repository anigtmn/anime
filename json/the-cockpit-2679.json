{"de":"1. Slipstream\nAbout a Luftwaffe pilot who must choose between his duty to his country: to guard a bomber loaded with Germany's final hope of victory... the world's first atomic bomb... or his duty to the world: to let it fall in flames to enemy Spitfires and be a footnote in history. Of course, things are complicated by the plane's other cargo... the woman he loves. \n\n2. Sonic Boom Squadron\nNear the end of the war, Japan has implemented a new weapon -- a human-piloted rocket-propelled flying bomb. Aboard a bomber carrying one of these, young Ensign Nogami awaits his chance to die as a \"cherry blossom\", a suicide pilot. In a few hours, he will die. The date of his death is set: August 6, 1945.\n\n3. Knight of the Iron Dragon\nTwo soldiers attempt to reach an air base in order to fulfill a promise despite the fact that it might have been rendered moot in the reality of war.\n\n(Source: ANN)","nm":"The Cockpit","jp":"The Cockpit","im":"https:\/\/img.bunnyccdn.co\/_r\/300x400\/100\/d4\/93\/d493bdbc236c22c66f5e299244647422\/d493bdbc236c22c66f5e299244647422.jpg","tp":"OVA","fi":"Finished Airing","rt":"7.22","tm":23,"dt":"Oct 22, 1993 to Jan 21, 1994","ge":["Historical","Military"],"st":["Madhouse"],"eps":{"1":{"i":[0,0,1390,1487],"f":"7b854c7e54014ee45a62ef3a15699b638c5f3113a4fafa93d3f6deea400bb7983d1e30d7fcb7f4102f9996f58dfafc1669a2cbf4cfe7548b709798849858a019b04c72443d5178b1a88002bd2d4019d55630497a1e3126f8affa067199e23d9a89a0ce8ad61613cdd65cd50c1956fa2cb05127a65111aa1676d712d0541cdcca","t":[["35\/ef\/35ef6a27d4120dcc3942c21d9b8bb401\/35ef6a27d4120dcc3942c21d9b8bb401.vtt","English"]]},"2":{"i":[0,0,1395,1495],"f":"002a97ae804344c383c3998bc685bb9424ef33f54fe6ebcf03bf7973d6f827d4038907e7e731034fad3b750f51dc0401b7c761594eafd9af315ade0011de47ac2708c8767771de1f3c09fd5a475f4303f79f01df45068cb095c2d98565584ee43f8871921895e7760abc86aa8eb66576a11e58f2d76cf1b147339cdfdde2af37","t":[["aa\/98\/aa98071bb8caa8f81a762b37b2b43d7c\/aa98071bb8caa8f81a762b37b2b43d7c.vtt","English"]]},"3":{"i":[0,0,1390,1485],"f":"46c132b2779dacfd6432ed477425cdca9fee10b76cc518d8360fc75bc8cf43aa9cbe51ef02905dcb429d9d8e2e6418b8e1b41d6456b074cddaffa8948a207cd04eb9f76890cbe9d8aed4607394435dd16b2f36283775b05f19e0005e4f02f85ba3851279696ef4bf4c082b550399cf27ff513db5c23a0d61d0d062bbe8c984d1","t":[["4a\/83\/4a83e445e90454f65b18a556841c814a\/4a83e445e90454f65b18a556841c814a.vtt","English"]]}}}
