{"de":"War rages between two neighboring countries, but one side has an ace up their sleeve: an ancient dragon bound by a pact to protect the nation. Despite these overpowering creatures being capable of leveling entire battlefields, they are rendered useless by cavities. And so, a special unit\u2014the dragon dentists\u2014has the important duty of caring for the dragon's teeth.\n\nNonoko Kishii was the only one of many brave volunteers who survived a recent round of recruitment; in order to join the dragon dentists, one has to witness their future demise and accept it without a fight. Knowing the exact circumstances of their fated ends, the dragon dentists devote themselves to their work. One day, they gain a new member who did not undergo the test: Bernard \"Bel\" Octavius, a young enemy officer killed by his own men and revived by the dragon's teeth. Despite his appearance being an omen of a great disaster, he is placed under the care of Nonoko as a dentist-in-training. Will Bel come around to the dragon dentists' attitudes toward death and help them face the painful future that is to come?","nm":"Ryuu no Haisha","jp":"Ryuu no Haisha","im":"https:\/\/img.bunnyccdn.co\/_r\/300x400\/100\/00\/73\/007303f01ea11aa16e6fb46f5f92b8e4\/007303f01ea11aa16e6fb46f5f92b8e4.jpg","tp":"Special","fi":"Finished Airing","rt":"7.44","tm":46,"dt":"Feb 18, 2017 to Feb 25, 2017","ge":["Adventure","Fantasy"],"st":["Khara"],"eps":{"1":{"i":[332,445,0,0],"f":"aa95b17c78f2d6727b2959b7b9e5c8760bc871d6f1116e6b599180c4810ab3920ec7368ab2f28c09877c434b18bb45c0d5ae9b31d3fc07c311bdfd5ac077046f4f16502fc6423de8f3c7dbb2a6bef44fa5cc4483ea931dcc0a5e1a51f30c0f41103f184df0eb5d2ad5495438e5df5d62f93cba1df833a39f6d7852b7cadefbc8","t":[["3b\/3e\/3b3eafa7ba489105f55c0ae6447963e9\/3b3eafa7ba489105f55c0ae6447963e9.vtt","English"]]},"2":{"i":[0,0,0,0],"f":"7368c4a9b1e3765f5af9580df93f7f0a360f8dabe9b4c46ff0be9aeb01ebc9620f918f05086c72e5d2af11f81555174e3110288e13dc2df9a7178432d638ad29a4f70a9a3e8a0eb97ccca22e03125d840766414369b512f292198f629c9da89c9f3dbf5050aca0963667f9e9cd0ed8d4b9cdc7d13acf2dc9587e224a3ccbf97f","t":[["78\/fa\/78fa1123d5770418d730915fadea62a9\/78fa1123d5770418d730915fadea62a9.vtt","English"]]}}}
