{"de":"Kei Kunieda is a newscaster who strictly maintains an amiable and kind persona while at work. Although he smiles on the outside, he covertly curses at others to his heart's content. His everyday life is smooth, even if he keeps half of himself hidden at all times, but that changes when he meets Ushio Tsuzuki, an independent stop-motion animator.\n\nSoon, Kei finds himself caught in a lie borne from his two personas meeting Ushio under different conditions, with the other man unaware they are the very same person. As feelings begin to blossom between them, Kei cannot be sure if Ushio will love both sides of him\u2014or only just half.","nm":"Yes ka no ka hanbunka","jp":"Yes ka No ka Hanbun ka","im":"https:\/\/img.bunnyccdn.co\/_r\/300x400\/100\/16\/e6\/16e6dd28044748ca13787fe4cc21f9f5\/16e6dd28044748ca13787fe4cc21f9f5.jpg","tp":"Movie","fi":"Finished Airing","rt":"0","tm":53,"dt":"Dec 11, 2020","ge":["Drama","Shounen Ai"],"st":["Lesprit"],"eps":{"1":{"i":[0,0,0,0],"f":"0a42db8594d6efd747ae58b0d69af159e5c6191c0d290b75ab7a069743f0036e71be568e05ec4e3e1d7db5184608aac8138e07b8269e288ae3d16a43b1752f6842d7d0b7e7bb50838b49935368679c5f8623d056042a7c772b3f99637069e6fe008cb8c57c2b172cbd301e82c9dc56446b0eb0c70431c9f2cd7b3ff1ba232b01","t":[["83\/b7\/83b7f813238ec480964e1239743c118d\/eng-2.vtt","English"]]}}}
