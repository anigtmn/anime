{"de":"Maeda is a new student in the Teiken High School. He stutters when he's nervous and he's rather clumsy. He gets noted immediately because he hits a teacher during the entrance ceremony. Some clubs search to enlist him as they see in him a force they can use to get even with other clubs. But Maeda is a loner and has only one dream: becoming a boxing champion.","nm":"Rokudenashi Blues","jp":"Rokudenashi Blues","im":"https:\/\/img.bunnyccdn.co\/_r\/300x400\/100\/f3\/aa\/f3aa1f48f30dbee590cb0f40eb5ddab2\/f3aa1f48f30dbee590cb0f40eb5ddab2.jpg","tp":"Movie","fi":"Finished Airing","rt":"5.87","tm":33,"dt":"Jul 11, 1992","ge":["Comedy","Drama","School","Shounen","Sports"],"st":["Toei Animation"],"eps":{"1":{"i":[0,0,0,0],"f":"f0d1c670a5dfd0f0e4fec75336e58d2e7cd3f19fcccd67f5965873acf59bc4d5a5cbc16b265bb13b30aa22a8ee560119ab728819acb576859b111dd58a9f0ec67cb3fc83e14d49a7f812b1db47fa3b1dcdef9e15fba3b4e5ee7631bdc44388ecef38152d2ffdb78ace38b9d990a52e159b710b05799bfc859cd4b5797f17e283","t":[["45\/89\/4589a43cb7bb4352efd89039cfd8948e\/4589a43cb7bb4352efd89039cfd8948e.vtt","English"]]}}}
