{"de":"In My Hero Academia: World Heroes\u2019 Mission, a mysterious terrorist group called the Humanize are introduced. They strongly believe in the \"Quirk Singularity Doomsday Theory.\" The theory states that as future generations continue to be mixed with the Quirk genes, the power it holds will lead to humanity\u2019s demise. Furthermore, Humanize believes that Quirks are a disease, and so, they plan to \u201ccleanse the world\u201d by exterminating anyone who has one.\n\nHumanize planted \"Ideo Trigger Bombs\" in various countries, and these explosives are said to make a Quirk-user lose control of their Quirk, leading to mass destruction. To save and protect everyone, Pro-Heroes from around the world, and the U.A. Academy heroes-in-training, unite to thwart the efforts of the mysterious group.","nm":"My Hero Academia the Movie 3: World Heroes' Mission","jp":"Boku no Hero Academia the Movie 3: World Heroes' Mission","im":"https:\/\/img.bunnyccdn.co\/_r\/300x400\/100\/37\/0d\/370d705e46efcfac81c0f7a7fb54a3be\/370d705e46efcfac81c0f7a7fb54a3be.jpg","tp":"Movie","fi":"Finished Airing","rt":"","tm":90,"dt":"Aug 6, 2021","ge":["Action","Comedy","School","Shounen","Super Power"],"st":["Bones"],"eps":{"1":{"i":[0,0,0,0],"f":"4623cb54bb0fce309316d2568d02d388e74b8ebd07317febc829fda94dc38a2e26b4125cc92b09e5c0e82ce634ce9e44094d95acb56cd7b489196e4074967afe5434d739faa3a5c851866a77d4aaf6269784c9b982bef619d8cd538a14d7926d0d3953c836eae88e581a152223828ab7b0363b3a843227d1c9ec55c22fe37bed","t":[["73\/eb\/73eb5e79239a77a4fc1b82580894efaf\/73eb5e79239a77a4fc1b82580894efaf.vtt","English - English"]]}}}
