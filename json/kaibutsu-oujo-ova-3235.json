He then awakens to a new life as a servant of a Princess of the Monster Realm, who just happens to be employing his sister. Monsters soon appear to attack or pester the princess since she is in line for the royal throne, and Hiro must protect her with his life (and repeated deaths).","nm":"Kaibutsu Oujo (OVA)","jp":"Kaibutsu Oujo (OVA)","im":"https:\/\/img.bunnyccdn.co\/_r\/300x400\/100\/a0\/78\/a07850917288810d38db92af378ad1a2\/a07850917288810d38db92af378ad1a2.jpg","tp":"OVA","fi":"Finished Airing","rt":"7.09","tm":22,"dt":"Dec 9, 2010 to Oct 7, 2011","ge":["Action","Comedy","Horror","Shounen","Supernatural"],"st":["Tatsunoko Production"],"eps":{"1":{"i":[0,0,0,0],"f":"54d561181eb5e0a4c5fb9458b947432795654a81a0cc442b097a17c1a30bd70178228e2c4dcefb60b06f1339de24dd5168b444f922984ff3cf545a3833420345d18f3b731db2c31d396f8c888340041f4b848139d3baf6df4d95ce374273306fcf5dc2c387218ba944886bf328e98c05ac7b32a9cb9a547a2051ea65759634d8","t":[["0b\/c9\/0bc900a9739b5e43af504814d8172f8d\/0bc900a9739b5e43af504814d8172f8d.vtt","English"]]},"2":{"i":[0,0,0,0],"f":"560ebb4ce101e9014455b865e30917b17673e08ccc38c06930b4748e07467f902685e2b718a39fe3af66b28c53c237672a7e3d808a656d9ba859ae68047f31091224645f3643affc0fd9b8ec898582e392dfa5bc2a753a98f6c0c541f042fe0f468d6b9bbe3aa49afb8be740c46bd6e9f363d48968bd31c169789372dc4300c2","t":[["7c\/66\/7c66be2d6d6cf42936fc3d4ce1952d9f\/7c66be2d6d6cf42936fc3d4ce1952d9f.vtt","English"]]},"3":{"i":[0,0,0,0],"f":"eb6009235747cac408c9c59aecfb623cd97e7019427749b8ac35ee0288b421233875f031bc853d9e50654f6e6ac1203ca0fc563dd0bb97743de9b6cd58e13f4e3bc8bf4c8f0e70ca395fc774fe1ade556177a72979efe6936f746fe4c30d406233111eb694f87c5f04c817ea8c5f7052a1cc589dd583ec4d9970e4884f121c04","t":[["b2\/65\/b265bd08135c70bbd9628019a6b607b9\/b265bd08135c70bbd9628019a6b607b9.vtt","English"]]}}}
