{"de":"On the day of the Tanabata festival, Shidou Itsuka happens to meet the eerie Kurumi Tokisaki, who proceeds to ask him out on a date. Although nervous, Shidou accepts the offer. The two spend their time visiting to a planetarium, buying food at the festival, and trying out a mock wedding ceremony. Meanwhile, Shirou's friends\u2014Tooka Yatogami, Yoshino, and Kotori Itsuka\u2014are looking for him, while also enjoying the festival themselves.\n \nAs Shidou spends the day with Kurumi, he begins to notice an unexpected softer side of her.
