{"de":"Two weeks before a concert at Yaon Hibiya auditorium (1987.8.26), while playing at the club Shinjuku Loft, lead vocalist To-Y (pron: to-o-i) of the band GASP is jumped by a rival, Aikawa Yoji. GASP is a upcoming band known for its violence, struggling to be noticed against the popularity of hotshot Aikawa, who's #1 on the charts and beloved by his fans. The Yaon Hibiya concert represents GASP's mainstream debut to break out of the small-time club scene, which is threatened by the schemes of Aikawa's manager, Ms. Kato of Koyama Productions. Kato wants To-Y to leave that \"bunch of hoodlums,\" and sing independently for a major label. \n\nAdding to the confusion is an unexplained character who manifests feline traits, named Niya. Niya presents herself as \"To-Y's aijin\" (\"Niya, To-Y no aijin da yo!\") to the consternation of Koishikawa Hiderou, who has interest in To-Y. Koishikawa, also known as \"Sonoko-chan,\" is typed as a \"okama\" by Niya. A running motif is GASP, it's fans, and associates regarded as unusual by the mainstream public, as exemplified by their musical taste, dress, and Classic Coke-drinking, which only contributes to more difficulty in their struggle to be accepted.","nm":"TO-Y","jp":"TO-Y","im":"https:\/\/img.bunnyccdn.co\/_r\/300x400\/100\/c8\/54\/c8542512fc09288219ea46a198e88609\/c8542512fc09288219ea46a198e88609.jpg","tp":"OVA","fi":"Finished Airing","rt":"6.2","tm":55,"dt":"Oct 1, 1987","ge":["Drama","Music","Shounen"],"st":["Gallop"],"eps":{"1":{"i":[0,0,0,0],"f":"4c259e6d8ff6ff0d10102d37da0badc128210cfa901fb269b52cf4d69dccbe5bd5fb1149aba77cdc7a2b0010446e286a894821206f5d67f0c5e4ead27e729f49d77d399d68a3e38bc4d16f89e854ab88521cc25d196d10e80db17dbe59989ff338bdadea8d4c275fd9d44def607450128b6759264594fe4cf80f02d169247682","t":[]}}}
