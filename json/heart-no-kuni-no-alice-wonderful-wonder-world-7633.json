{"de":"The girly but bloody otome game re-imagining of Lewis Carroll's classic fantasy novel Alice's Adventures in Wonderland with bishounen characters and added romance.\n\nA parody of Alice's Adventures in Wonderland where Alice is smart and non-doormatlike.\n\nIn this story, Alice is not all what she seems. She is practical, strong, yet darkly cynical. Instead of the tradition story, Alice is kidnapped unwillingly by a mysterious (yet somewhat bishie-looking) man with bunny ears into a place call Heartland. Stuck in Heartland due to a trick by the mysterious bunny eared man, she meets the residents of this world. Along the way, Alice meets Blood, handsome mafia leader; Ace, the psycho yet charming knight and more... What should Alice do in such a world!?","nm":"Heart no Kuni no Alice: Wonderful Wonder World","jp":"Heart no Kuni no Alice: Wonderful Wonder World","im":"https:\/\/img.bunnyccdn.co\/_r\/300x400\/100\/fe\/db\/fedbe02bbc00b2fb0e897bb1bd7c4e09\/fedbe02bbc00b2fb0e897bb1bd7c4e09.jpg","tp":"Movie","fi":"Finished Airing","rt":"6.1","tm":84,"dt":"Jul 30, 2011","ge":["Fantasy","Romance","Shoujo","Harem"],"st":["Asahi Production"],"eps":{"1":{"i":[0,0,0,0],"f":"ad0b5ca6a58906081c07cd6825813d3de45a7ee8634400c30e41bced9de6d019e0378920a408c807b489cf6c74144c9b0cf40308c6857ea030faa9bbf42942abdfcfccf06a1a900ced228dd8acc07139f9ec72d904c44e10e8f863397cec98be470ab92f55fbd5e8eabd4bc5ab4ff8c1","t":[["12\/c8\/12c869618e3dfbe4688ac6f6ff26f5f4\/12c869618e3dfbe4688ac6f6ff26f5f4.vtt","English"]]}}}
