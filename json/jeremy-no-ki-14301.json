The tree was then cut down for people in the city to use for Christmas celebrations. The bird desperately is trying to find its adoptive tree mother with the help of Jeremy, a penniless orphan, who heard her story so they go and search every tree being used in town. The search in the cold takes a toll on Jeremy until Santa Claus appears, but is it really him?","nm":"Jeremy no Ki","jp":"Jeremy no Ki","im":"https:\/\/img.bunnyccdn.co\/_r\/300x400\/100\/5b\/c4\/5bc45ae229108dde10dfbaa902c2c3fa\/5bc45ae229108dde10dfbaa902c2c3fa.jpg","tp":"Movie","fi":"Finished Airing","rt":"5.67","tm":21,"dt":"Apr 29, 1983","ge":["Drama","Fantasy","Kids"],"st":[],"eps":{"1":{"i":[0,0,0,0],"f":"6c63a7ae895ae8ab99ab61bee199a2c975106b12039986fa8ff3b60a645f0e9e7b48d3352840d8a7e5491092fd86213af72d895774c6c661df1ba5461eb986db500dfa267939f57e704794f094c498d2344b988ec5ca0479c9c7623f870223e8441ff5767a4477c2397a5a6b18557de28a8f717cdc6edd0d10159657571664b4","t":[["c1\/65\/c16545a0457afe8c9af003acf86d55ed\/c16545a0457afe8c9af003acf86d55ed.vtt","English"]]}}}
