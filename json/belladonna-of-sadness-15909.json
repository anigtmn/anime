{"de":"The beautiful Jeanne marries a man named Jean, and the happy newlyweds make their way to the Lord's castle with a cow's worth of money for his blessings. However, the demonic Lord is unmoved by their offering, ignoring their desperate, impoverished pleas. The Lord's wife offers an alternative: Jeanne must become the Lord's conquest for the night in a ritual deflowering.\n\nScarred by the experience, the shaken Jeanne receives no sympathy from her husband. Instead, she is neglected. But as Jeanne drifts off to sleep, she is met by a strange spirit that encourages her to deliver retribution to those who wronged her. And with a mysterious surge of pleasure and an unquenching libido, Jeanne agrees.\n\nKanashimi no Belladonna is a captivating, psychosexual adventure that tells a story of cunning witchcraft and deceitful superstition in a poor, rural village of medieval France.","nm":"Belladonna of Sadness","jp":"Kanashimi no Belladonna","im":"https:\/\/img.bunnyccdn.co\/_r\/300x400\/100\/67\/e2\/67e2c92a99937aa8b233a7128609e65a\/67e2c92a99937aa8b233a7128609e65a.jpg","tp":"Movie","fi":"Finished Airing","rt":"7.12","tm":87,"dt":"Jun 30, 1973","ge":["Dementia","Drama","Historical"],"st":["Mushi Production"],"eps":{"1":{"i":[0,0,0,0],"f":"dcaaacc683bc2ba385a3d166a4edf047179483ce38528081fc44d8522409f3425775b599da431f00fbe62e840f0352e26fccc62fd00a36f67a14ee1ab8aec0125de5eba50d5808dee96475e4dd7f48d2d87df0fc7b3a2833697f74e7f326cb5f84957c31ca6bbbb871bd77accb80d07d187df8671a982f56549711906c104646","t":[["88\/92\/88925094a2851aaf4d16ecdf4a058bf4\/88925094a2851aaf4d16ecdf4a058bf4.vtt","English"]]}}}
