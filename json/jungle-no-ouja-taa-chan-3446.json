{"de":"Ta-chan is the king of jungle. He was abandoned in savanna, and has been raised by a chimpanzee, Etekichi. He has a dearest wife, Jane who used to be a top model in New York, but now she looks... Anyway, to protect animals from poachers, Ta-chan is fighting against them with his disciple, Pedro, and a master of Chinese martial arts, Ryo.\n\nThis anime is based on the manga with the same title; it begins as a comical parody of Tarzan. The first several episodes are comedies, but the rest of the series consists of (rather) serious episodes.\n\n(Source: AnimeNfo)","nm":"Jungle no Ouja Taa-chan","jp":"Jungle no Ouja Taa-chan","im":"https:\/\/img.bunnyccdn.co\/_r\/300x400\/100\/fb\/23\/fb2379d1623b8592f691c760520419dc\/fb2379d1623b8592f691c760520419dc.jpg","tp":"TV Series","fi":"Finished Airing","rt":"7.02","tm":24,"dt":"Oct 14, 1993 to Sep 29, 1994","ge":["Action","Comedy","Parody"],"st":["Group TAC"],"eps":{"1":{"i":[0,0,0,0],"f":"0adfbdb14970d6d6e315c077691045712633cffa329d6a944a3a4c90d8f5f96d4354387e3c9c024d76bd7342a12d75bbd2beb0e93602762a722c52525db6356ad820c432826972205baff9864f220b0438d6fc0facb0d341a7ab96bddf123b3daa5439a06b90b66e5f05c5644a433436701b617317ac3bd1773a0eb096a982e7","t":[["72\/40\/7240976dd80f0af38a1d272621944733\/7240976dd80f0af38a1d272621944733.vtt","English"]]}}}
