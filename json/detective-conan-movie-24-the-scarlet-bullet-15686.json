{"de":"24th Detective Conan Movie. Japan is celebrating the upcoming World Sports Games (WSG), the world's largest sporting event, in Tokyo. The \"Japanese Bullet,\" the world's first vacuum-tube super-conducting linear train, is built with the latest Japanese technology and timed to coincide with the WSG opening ceremonies. The train is set to run from Shin Nagoya Station to Tokyo Station at up to 1,000 kilometers per hour (about 600 miles per hour). However, a bizarre incident occurs during a party held by famous major sponsors, leading to a string of kidnappings of top executives. Conan deduces a possible link to serial abductions in the WSG 15 years earlier in Boston.","nm":"Detective Conan Movie 24: The Scarlet Bullet","jp":"Detective Conan Movie 24: Hiiro no Dangan","im":"https:\/\/img.bunnyccdn.co\/_r\/300x400\/100\/08\/ef\/08ef8ab96bc564c85cf7c2dff8f19fb9\/08ef8ab96bc564c85cf7c2dff8f19fb9.png","tp":"Movie","fi":"Finished Airing","rt":"7.72","tm":110,"dt":"Apr 16, 2021","ge":["Action","Comedy","Mystery","Drama","Shounen","Police"],"st":["TMS Entertainment"],"eps":{"1":{"i":[0,0,0,0],"f":"411e59f12ff1966a0098f68df145c67771f0d38a2968445d4eb5f850738d399031a5ceb488ac054e61fddda201a8eb481fe838b207099b103474d89a636d09eb04fe06e68fb6c2d47a5ad5e4047861ccce6b78e118370ed622f436b8ab10c9fdd83718de7d1bf02a2f77c4a02c0df7791360287d77c2a9730446bfe851f6c312","t":[["06\/03\/0603e91545539090ede8783b812099ea\/0603e91545539090ede8783b812099ea.vtt","Vietnamese"]]}}}
