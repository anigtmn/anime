{"de":"Hoichiro Ohma works in an office. Everybody knows him as a silent, humble man. Even his girlfriend, Nanase, doesn't suspect that he could be something more, but he is. When a person dies as a victim of murder; when someone kills himself with a curse on his lips; when someone's death needs to be judged, he is there, for he is a Judge Of Darkness. Following the Laws Of Darkness, with a book made of human skin and an unusual parrot, he pronounces judgement over living criminals that would otherwise go free.","nm":"Judge","jp":"Yami no Shihosha Judge","im":"https:\/\/img.bunnyccdn.co\/_r\/300x400\/100\/d8\/aa\/d8aa7040ff9aab64d57965cb853506d5\/d8aa7040ff9aab64d57965cb853506d5.jpg","tp":"OVA","fi":"Finished Airing","rt":"5.37","tm":48,"dt":"Jun 15, 1991","ge":["Horror","Supernatural","Seinen"],"st":["J.C.Staff","animate Film"],"eps":{"1":{"i":[0,0,0,0],"f":"93ecad1e55b3a7f50adb1e1581186cf054c4463b403d426fd9a77cc0abb3398628dea8fd206779392e6597f532cb033f023e5c40eb329651b19033db56c8437f8c578048bd3be2c823e282750b93ec067ec71fefea360570a5737c2779a1de23387191266936d8a31f4fc8d56ccdd74202b76d30987e342e02de936bc533752d","t":[["a7\/1e\/a71e30cf57dfc20c1100db8a4a1b15c6\/a71e30cf57dfc20c1100db8a4a1b15c6.vtt","English"]]}}}
