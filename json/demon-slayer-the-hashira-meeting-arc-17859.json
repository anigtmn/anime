{"de":"The Hashira Training conducted by the Hashira is a special training session that aims to improve all Demon Slayers' abilities and physical health. The training is split between the Hashiras. First, the Sound Hashira, Uzui Tengen conducts training on basic stamina. Then, the Love Hashira, Kanroji Mitsuri handles flexibility training and the Mist Hashira, Muichirou Tokito, deals with the quick movement training.\n\nThe Snake Hashira, Obanai Iguro, then focuses on sword skill revision, followed up by the Wind Hashira, Sanemi Shinazugawa, who handles pounding training and finally the Rock Hashira, Gyomei Himejima, who trains muscle reinforcement. The Insect Hashira, Shinobu Kocho does not take part in the training.\n\nThe majority of the Demon Slayers view the training session as an everlasting trip in hell, with the exception of Tanjiro Kamado and Inosuke Hashibira who see the session as a chance to improve themselves. As a general rule, Hashira must take part in each other's training sessions. It is considered a win-win situation for both the Hashira and the Demon Slayers as even the Hashira get to improve due to being constantly attacked by wave upon wave of juniors ranked lower than themselves.","nm":"Demon Slayer: The Hashira Meeting Arc","jp":"Demon Slayer: The Hashira Meeting Arc","im":"https:\/\/img.bunnyccdn.co\/_r\/300x400\/100\/f4\/db\/f4db3749989c98cd4a4513b003737e8d\/f4db3749989c98cd4a4513b003737e8d.jpg","tp":"Movie","fi":"Finished Airing","rt":"","tm":160,"dt":"?","ge":["Action","Mystery","Fantasy","Historical"],"st":["ufotable"],"eps":{"1":{"i":[0,0,0,0],"f":"a92981dd8cba29c307c44aba6766f9721497fc8e822512c8d9ef8840b951f02f4b6de2fa5cef9d97ca8409f940e2b3e5fd4f150cb23671d91f556fecc237b16760ca809d0a13e13a48f664be9cc91eaf9a185d1ee7ad8b394a55b1332a8d719f59ab7043be6c29a5387c40a410fb106ed9a9536e4cf95a80b8868d23cb075658","t":[]}}}
