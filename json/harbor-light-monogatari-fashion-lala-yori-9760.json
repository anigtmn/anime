{"de":"A Cinderella story of sorts, Fashion Lala stars a little girl named Miho who doesn't get along with her family. Miho loves to design clothing, but her aunt and three cousins don't believe that such a young girl is capable and mock her designs. Meanwhile, a contest for the new \"Disco Queen\" is coming up, and Miho wants nothing more than to be able to design a dress for someone to wear to the competition, since she's too young to enter herself. With determination and a little bit of magic, Miho's dreams just might come true!","nm":"Harbor Light Monogatari: Fashion Lala yori","jp":"Harbor Light Monogatari: Fashion Lala yori","im":"https:\/\/img.bunnyccdn.co\/_r\/300x400\/100\/16\/d6\/16d6355e88a2fe7a9570cfbd9199bfba\/16d6355e88a2fe7a9570cfbd9199bfba.jpg","tp":"OVA","fi":"Finished Airing","rt":"5.33","tm":48,"dt":"Mar 11, 1988","ge":["Shoujo"],"st":["Studio Pierrot"],"eps":{"1":{"i":[0,0,0,0],"f":"3face0d81e3cab6912e1fd51b0747b9ae032111e636d35d1c0773691c00f986b5973a5bf7a1e16c6bede5b29cd26989a229b88ba76eb1c6a84d7962c5464b10c3d42f7c128e19cc717763297a7cdd8797406d6f15d81aef5d728ae1a01c084a2b5761c8e65384278ef4257c0a86c7d12351c2b9fb69cdc35af83a693b78d6f02","t":[["aa\/b4\/aab4d03c5d4ab98c7dd4e7547413652d\/aab4d03c5d4ab98c7dd4e7547413652d.vtt","English"]]}}}
