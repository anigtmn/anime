{"de":"It's a Sanrio picture that feels partly like an anime art film and partly like a Warner Bros. cartoon. The film features some very creative imagery, a groovy 70's jazz score, and very little spoken dialogue. It's a story about a dog named Joe that falls in love with a rose and protects it from a mean spirited crow. There's some energetic Fritz Freeling style action. There's also some unexpectedly grim tragedy, not including the anticipated outcome, which does occur as expected.","nm":"Bara no Hana to Joe","jp":"Bara no Hana to Joe","im":"https:\/\/img.bunnyccdn.co\/_r\/300x400\/100\/8b\/b9\/8bb939b78deb1a3599c9eea8dd283ef8\/8bb939b78deb1a3599c9eea8dd283ef8.jpg","tp":"Movie","fi":"Finished Airing","rt":"5.74","tm":20,"dt":"Mar 1, 1977","ge":["Drama","Kids"],"st":[],"eps":{"1":{"i":[0,0,0,0],"f":"9b1e810d2c9eacf7c727ce3690dd0f98b81898786df75748a1a5fbda56f044248a266453ab119acf904739a6bb2d4553680024c65b55776f20c897087886e45cd6448c2729ee883bb2e20adeaac6911c1a0034e74576224f0ef4700cdb9215e7303858a2449e392b331bbea2292d02308eafb8f6a8f95b3e562c85eb0f98f8e8","t":[["a6\/41\/a641679ba116ae7ca75b611001b7c555\/a641679ba116ae7ca75b611001b7c555.vtt","English"]]}}}
