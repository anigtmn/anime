{"de":"An ancient prophecy tells of a day when the titans of ice, lightning, and fire are disturbed. When this occurs, Lugia, the guardian of the sea, will rise up and restore harmony. Enchanted by the words of the prophecy, Gelardan, a Pok\u00e9mon collector, sets out on his airship with a dreadful plan to capture Lugia by going after these three titans. \n\nAfter Gelardan makes his move, drastic climate change begins to take place, as terrible storms start popping up all over the globe. One such storm causes the ship carrying Pok\u00e9mon trainers Satoshi, Kasumi, and Kenji to drift off course and land on Earthia Island. Upon arriving, Satoshi is told of the ancient prophecy, and of his destiny as the chosen one who will help Lugia restore balance to the world. \n\nWith the fate of the world in his hands, Satoshi must summon the courage to face the chaos that threatens to tear everything apart and stop Gelardan.","nm":"Pokemon The Movie 02: The Movie 2000 - The Power of One","jp":"Pokemon Movie 02: Maboroshi no Pokemon Lugia Bakutan","im":"https:\/\/img.bunnyccdn.co\/_r\/300x400\/100\/1d\/04\/1d04dc09e43aee4a5c0567b8f718b767\/1d04dc09e43aee4a5c0567b8f718b767.jpg","tp":"Movie","fi":"Finished Airing","rt":"7.38","tm":80,"dt":"Jul 17, 1999","ge":["Adventure","Comedy","Drama","Fantasy","Kids"],"st":["OLM"],"eps":{"1":{"i":[0,0,0,0],"f":"f31b6838c958ee886ac8384daf597948492df025ece0c64256d51500dcd4869b2023a5a9dd84a439c85f812f68bdb3ccedfc9eab2045d4957d11f4844ee98a4059724975962f51b09b90aff07cf9369d31befb1758975571cb0db88fb043e438148737b5c3d2e0923bcfff507be605db59248d042366dc5570b74aabc75c79c3","t":[["05\/8d\/058dbc60f5fe2a37278adaa2205885ad\/058dbc60f5fe2a37278adaa2205885ad.vtt","English"]]}}}
