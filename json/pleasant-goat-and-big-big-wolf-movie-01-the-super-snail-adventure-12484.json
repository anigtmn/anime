{"de":"In 3131, the goats lived on Qingqing Field happily, and the Grey Wolf lived in the castle with his wife named Red Wolf beyond the Qingqing Field. Every time when Grey Wolf appeared on the Qingqing Field, and was going to catch the goats, all the goats would work together and chucked the wolf out of Qingqing Field.\n\nPGBBW is a classic story line of a village of happy-go-lucky goats and their not-so-friendly wolf neighbors. Each episode explores the wolf\u2019s latest scheme to catch himself goat for dinner. Despite his attempts, the goats in the village always seem to outsmart the wolf\u2014all while creating a funny and adventurous plot line.","nm":"Pleasant Goat and Big Big Wolf: Movie 01 - The Super Snail Adventure","jp":"Xi Yang Yang Yu Hui Tai Lang: Zhi Niu Qi Chong Tian","im":"https:\/\/img.bunnyccdn.co\/_r\/300x400\/100\/1a\/74\/1a74afc7403d521b25ca82b095643509\/1a74afc7403d521b25ca82b095643509.jpg","tp":"Movie","fi":"Finished Airing","rt":"0","tm":85,"dt":"Jan 16, 2009","ge":["Adventure","Comedy","Kids"],"st":[],"eps":{"1":{"i":[0,0,0,0],"f":"e3f742c2aeb5736433dd9fe932372a3a6963b1963cae9981ac9a82141a97cda59306243130020c09085f438103f6e0875b18ceecbb38bdd406add1ebfca01fb4d31c181eb5094e6938dfc61314c154a76ea9b41c3ca86aecdda12e2fbd8a4598dc3e775024c9f511dfae4c7d0ef4ef3574f56f30ea4dfd67a344ee5917c48c33","t":[]}}}
