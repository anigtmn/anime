{"de":"Time has come to a standstill. A whale appears from a glassy ocean and spends half a day soaring gracefully across the skies. What makes this works extraordinary is the artist's decision to use the transparency and visual bulk of 3D computer graphics only for the un-moving ocean and glaciers. The people, whale, and ships are all hand-drawn, and with this contrast, he invites the viewer into a different world. This is a poem written in animation, the creation of a true fantasy. This project was a considerable under taking, and the results are marvelous.","nm":"Glassy Ocean","jp":"Kujira no Chouyaku","im":"https:\/\/img.bunnyccdn.co\/_r\/300x400\/100\/2d\/3a\/2d3a55bace6a3532a50180d3681c8f52\/2d3a55bace6a3532a50180d3681c8f52.jpg","tp":"Movie","fi":"Finished Airing","rt":"6.67","tm":22,"dt":"Nov 14, 1998","ge":["Drama","Fantasy","Kids"],"st":["Tamura Shigeru Studio"],"eps":{"1":{"i":[0,0,0,0],"f":"1ffa5df06e022186950d8cc1b8565204921bb32bffb459fcb141d7138a0eab0b2b8d0f611dabc7986afeb76ab0f27a4055d846940381e4141483f7790f94be700a5a8959aa027f2e810ff0d400fe49b1b75c66d1bc852d966ef922302768b01091ba1d1cfb5decd1a7ec03777b696aa22e448734690ac9e11f7bd8dbc57164bf","t":[["38\/ab\/38abd2f92106dc5e26a86199f8a8722c\/38abd2f92106dc5e26a86199f8a8722c.vtt","English"]]}}}
