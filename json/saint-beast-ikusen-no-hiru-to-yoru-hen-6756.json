{"de":"Long ago there was a war in Heaven which resulted in Judas and Luca \u2013 two of the six specially-chosen, talented and strong Saint Beasts \u2013 being cast out and imprisoned in Hell for leading the rebellion. But before that Heaven had been a peaceful place where the angels happily lived their lives. In this time, Judas, Luca, Goh, Shin, Rey and Gai are adolescent angels in Heaven who, on the day of Benediction, are made into adults by the supreme god Zeus. With each of the six having their own special abilities and new adult bodies to get used to, opportunities to meet each other arise and new friendships are formed. \n\n(Source: Anivide)","nm":"Saint Beast: Ikusen no Hiru to Yoru-hen OVA","jp":"Saint Beast: Ikusen no Hiru to Yoru-hen","im":"https:\/\/img.bunnyccdn.co\/_r\/300x400\/100\/73\/fb\/73fb37fec45f9a1485259290f043b65b\/73fb37fec45f9a1485259290f043b65b.jpg","tp":"OVA","fi":"Finished Airing","rt":"6.3","tm":50,"dt":"Dec 17, 2005 to Mar 18, 2006","ge":["Fantasy","Magic"],"st":["Madhouse"],"eps":{"1":{"i":[0,0,0,0],"f":"e9b5ace6c025d733d05fc67fa4a4293a1687a3c506ee56b3069dfb80701977a4c08e5f8d8d47cc35a29b5401c2002d414e7eed81b8e53207c5c67049f596e3c427d38eba3ceeedc5fdcb879bb15709ec13adf1eadf159144d99857f8bbfa9731a3b8b916d85725234d03846f7d7e54bf","t":[]}}}
