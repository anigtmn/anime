{"de":"\"A man with arms which can kill people like puppets is not aware that he himself has already become a puppet.\" In this short hand-drawn silent animation, a wandering samurai learns this lesson firsthand.\n\nAlong his travels, the samurai comes across a straw dummy at the base of a tree, with a sword lodged in its body. Upon drawing it out, the samurai learns that the blade is imbued with magic, and immensely powerful. The power comes at a price, though, and wielding the blade begins to slowly drive the warrior mad. He now has a choice to make: remain himself, or sacrifice his sanity for ultimate power?","nm":"Muramasa","jp":"Muramasa","im":"https:\/\/img.bunnyccdn.co\/_r\/300x400\/100\/8a\/9a\/8a9a7c9c1072eca23ff99aa74e298b5f\/8a9a7c9c1072eca23ff99aa74e298b5f.jpg","tp":"Movie","fi":"Finished Airing","rt":"6.21","tm":8,"dt":"Aug 21, 1987","ge":["Historical","Horror","Martial Arts","Samurai"],"st":[],"eps":{"1":{"i":[0,0,0,0],"f":"a0621c77fd0b0436ed0cb04125e5bbb0a08b3d3dca16ba22706b7bb47fd537555226b3b81d4274ac7224729492fd91d28fffcd96617219660dbaa74ab05bc363ffe81efcf286c553d6423e6a1ff874a0ac7547fdd8fde9043ec1957f99f2b444347914fbc4f0dae7470e764aae024416a21070ea98d01300056c6345282ab960","t":[["06\/65\/0665c2c19a0084e0ac772691da26d4bd\/0665c2c19a0084e0ac772691da26d4bd.vtt","English"]]}}}
