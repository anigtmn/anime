{"de":"In 2015, the Chaldea Security Organization draws on experts of both the magical and mundane fields to observe the future of mankind for possible extinction events. Humanity's survival seems assured for the next century\u2014until the verdict suddenly changes, and now eradication of the species awaits at the end of 2016. The cause is unknown, but appears to be linked with the Japanese town of Fuyuki and the events of 2004 during the Fifth Holy Grail War.\n\nIn response, Chaldea harnesses an experimental means of time travel, the Rayshift technology. With it, Ritsuka Fujimaru, a young man newly recruited to the organization, and the mysterious girl Mash Kyrielight, can travel back to 2004 and discover how to save humanity. A grand order to fight fate has been declared\u2014an order to change the past and restore the future.","nm":"Fate\/Grand Order -First Order-","jp":"Fate\/Grand Order: First Order","im":"https:\/\/img.bunnyccdn.co\/_r\/300x400\/100\/b2\/52\/b2524ebf8c491cc4521356e50178ab86\/b2524ebf8c491cc4521356e50178ab86.jpg","tp":"Special","fi":"Finished Airing","rt":"6.8","tm":74,"dt":"Dec 31, 2016","ge":["Action","Fantasy","Magic","Supernatural"],"st":["Lay-duce"],"eps":{"1":{"i":[0,0,0,0],"f":"faa75ae501027f099d1d5fa992f523447f26beca3031abfce0f295e1a8d04e789163555c4fbd00ed038980957adee984e1fb287a64446f2c73c0d98b61e8d5f5eb6d747fbd6ed81374e223dd778a0a44c4fb5f88e96ae9cfdc2a6a75ab0ca483e053fe18ee0eb774027edc7c39d58bf20c4106aa9633cd6422eb0fa61e1d07f3","t":[["8e\/10\/8e10c8dd5944ed4a754ccccef56822e1\/ara-5.vtt","Arabic"],["8e\/10\/8e10c8dd5944ed4a754ccccef56822e1\/eng-2.vtt","English"],["8e\/10\/8e10c8dd5944ed4a754ccccef56822e1\/fre-6.vtt","French"],["8e\/10\/8e10c8dd5944ed4a754ccccef56822e1\/ita-7.vtt","Italian"],["8e\/10\/8e10c8dd5944ed4a754ccccef56822e1\/por-4.vtt","Portuguese - Portugues(Brasil)"],["8e\/10\/8e10c8dd5944ed4a754ccccef56822e1\/spa-3.vtt","Spanish - Espanol"]]}}}
