Mine tans under the bright sun while Nodame and Masumi enjoy a refreshing swim; Chiaki sits inside the beach club, trying his best to hide his fear of the sea. When Nodame suggests renting an inflatable boat to row over to a small island, will Chiaki be able to keep his secret?","nm":"Nodame Cantabile: Nodame to Chiaki no Umi Monogatari","jp":"Nodame Cantabile: Nodame to Chiaki no Umi Monogatari","im":"https:\/\/img.bunnyccdn.co\/_r\/300x400\/100\/83\/e0\/83e02a832394520397f53d4eacf048da\/83e02a832394520397f53d4eacf048da.jpg","tp":"Special","fi":"Finished Airing","rt":"7.39","tm":15,"dt":"Feb 16, 2008","ge":["Comedy","Romance","Slice of Life","Josei"],"st":["J.C.Staff"],"eps":{"1":{"i":[0,0,0,0],"f":"9c30a1c1f6ac539f7406fef5921e280ee3f31fafd317a27a6360240c25fec8ea3f9698e850102a21185c63d97659f8e3c8cb168c7481c2d130a05123ab2b2fbdfc59de440c8679be2a8b07a4301a6ea7ed345233f08149c7450843f08f136eb62d970ec75d524303c3a02cfc27b8dd777c4afbd0778f108fd8075af1aaa0ab07","t":[["78\/ab\/78ab36a6486bd0c3cd1930f2fb3bf79d\/78ab36a6486bd0c3cd1930f2fb3bf79d.vtt","English"]]}}}
