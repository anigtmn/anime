One day, Masamune's mysterious classmate Mutsumi guides him to the fifth furnace of the steel mill, where they encounter a girl who cannot speak and resembles a wild wolf. The meeting between the two girls and Masamune disrupts the balance of the world, and the unstoppable \"impulse of love\" from boys and girls tired of their daily lives begins to destroy the world.","nm":"Maboroshi","jp":"Alice to Therese no Maboroshi Koujou","im":"https:\/\/img.bunnyccdn.co\/_r\/300x400\/100\/80\/66\/80668730f0614c76d9dd374052f9d990\/80668730f0614c76d9dd374052f9d990.jpg","tp":"Movie","fi":"Finished Airing","rt":"7.24","tm":110,"dt":"Sep 15, 2023","ge":["Drama","Fantasy","Romance"],"st":["MAPPA"],"eps":{"1":{"i":[0,0,0,0],"f":"c5b1b53d22567a385025a6c0c55a9a7678499fd26902d8fcdcb273c319aecc628c0448fcbc7bc826bafc036bcf78c6132f7cefc39f0e30d7ecf2b61234a46ba87e22d97a7a4d8aab989268a9da07e49e26060368350553d254367c7c902d53f1c6e0a8a426abf736c4b0d4ee337ded07bde0750b50bd7faee365a1908e8abb1f","t":[["7d\/ee\/7dee4b2b1dcd3c03ed284a391b231a23\/7dee4b2b1dcd3c03ed284a391b231a23.vtt","English"]]}}}
