{"de":"On a sunny day, Mihoshi Kuramitsu decides to take a peaceful nap while everyone else does chores. Sick of Mihoshi's laziness, Aeka Jurai Masaki questions her capability as a Galaxy Police Officer. Her pride wounded, Mihoshi decides to prove that she is a skilled first class detective by telling the story of how she and her partner, Kiyone Makibi, put a stop to a series of thefts involving Ultra Energy Matter. \n\nTo make it more fun, Mihoshi inserts Tenchi Masaki and the others into her story. However, her fantastical tale may just demonstrate her lack of a grip on reality rather than showcase her accomplishment as a talented officer.","nm":"Tenchi Muyou!: Galaxy Police Mihoshi Space Adventure","jp":"Tenchi Muyou!: Galaxy Police Mihoshi Space Adventure","im":"https:\/\/img.bunnyccdn.co\/_r\/300x400\/100\/84\/31\/8431d7c02bd105b34e03762885a5803d\/8431d7c02bd105b34e03762885a5803d.jpg","tp":"OVA","fi":"Finished Airing","rt":"6.82","tm":27,"dt":"Mar 25, 1994","ge":["Comedy","Magic","Parody","Sci-Fi","Shounen","Space","Police"],"st":["AIC"],"eps":{"1":{"i":[0,0,0,0],"f":"e39c6256980eda18242349396e559e6494bb2b03abb701a34b9769f2da07129f23c8fb56c7057a398b2ab9148e8a13438b14c8008eb576bc7ad45008108523f4dfb4ed3638b394b70fb8b3068582449ac20572d826d9ab22953b68ecda665a2b57ba06b8f023ee81e9da6bb86e680d74b812140c87825b5bdc9683aadd8fe8a0","t":[["0a\/07\/0a07434b05133269c1505ea0b0664a1b\/0a07434b05133269c1505ea0b0664a1b.vtt","English"]]}}}
