{"de":"The All-Star Tournament is a three-day event that allows e-sports participants from various professional clubs to display their skills, while also giving casual Glory players the chance to interact with pros in the flesh.\n\nRetired top-tier Glory player Ye Xiu agrees to watch the tournament together with Tang Rou and Chen Guo after the latter manages to get ahold of three tickets. It is a strange sensation for Ye Xiu, as unlike previous occasions, this time he attends the tournament as a spectator, not a participant. However, despite his attempts to keep a low profile, events in the All-Star Tournament may force the former Glory legend back into the limelight.","nm":"The King's Avatar (2018)","jp":"Quanzhi Gaoshou Specials","im":"https:\/\/img.bunnyccdn.co\/_r\/300x400\/100\/66\/59\/66593edc09cc6cb7ab42381a47c8fb64\/66593edc09cc6cb7ab42381a47c8fb64.jpg","tp":"ONA","fi":"Finished Airing","rt":"8.26","tm":27,"dt":"Apr 27, 2018 to May 11, 2018","ge":["Action","Game"],"st":[],"eps":{"1":{"i":[0,0,0,0],"f":"275149532341593a568cbe78bcb7850a88b35c3eda305ff6dc23d12963e2438fe047c86821df67dedf05ce9ee65aefa061d2397c71ec5007ced9f6fa9fdd9094b77d076f58c1e285b69ce396cf79a937990777f22c8eef153084a6d020fbc75267afd9b2a99c73398153752af8af565c12b1f1305030087ba3c445a5e97746b4","t":[]},"2":{"i":[0,0,0,0],"f":"7d64f9ad7b3a552b2847921eecfb42b6bce249a243f9f8f1113d6182b096b156dabdd4f700c0c671b6c5d6fa831e9a8e031c558d32c43985ccc7c6c540ed3466d9f6dbf5b5952c0d572fe2210543e10e07b7e22b615a75c8723bedd6ddadf34123a6920d3ac71aea6636dffa9fa0dfde1b500fad09707278886e79ea647edfd6","t":[]},"3":{"i":[0,0,0,0],"f":"325a0791a6b36250f6957bb5bb6573e121ff4a5eaa44c6e53e358cefe12ec6a6ceb420f2aaaa988ba414f0ffe55e6eb3c2ebd4a4f52e3a2dfc8ff1f83db79e10b0aab3c9f749d7bad2efc550ad6d03ee3ba30689463a3e039743389dcddcfba9d8f1335abd3bc897eee832be33676dab21033e30783582825935098378f649ff","t":[]}}}
