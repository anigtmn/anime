{"de":"Koyomi Araragi is studying hard in preparation for his college entrance exams when he begins to notice something very strange: his reflection no longer appears in a mirror, a characteristic of a true vampire. Worried about the state of his body, he enlists the help of the human-like doll Yotsugi Ononoki and her master Yozuru Kagenui, an immortal oddity specialist.\n\nQuickly realizing what is wrong with him, Yozuru gives him two choices: either abstain from using the vampiric abilities he received from Shinobu Oshino, or lose his humanity forever.","nm":"Tsukimonogatari","jp":"Tsukimonogatari","im":"https:\/\/img.bunnyccdn.co\/_r\/300x400\/100\/19\/2e\/192ea2390fb73d99b4640b6303215240\/192ea2390fb73d99b4640b6303215240.jpg","tp":"TV Series","fi":"Finished Airing","rt":"8.15","tm":80,"dt":"Dec 31, 2014","ge":["Comedy","Mystery","Ecchi","Supernatural"],"st":["Shaft"],"eps":{"1":{"i":[0,0,0,0],"f":"f5c0cd44fcef3b80ee9bc87c76a3418ca7ecf6315d9590776b98e18efc875fbf53ec14a1dd5e00551146d845fc80ecced39ce4caba3ee8c87b0aa34948ec838eccd12c83cfe323a977f7b1bd2c4960f82ddf690524543def9bbc0b5b36b5733ad88def2bcddd1b4cda65e019db28874ec9bfd9b94ed6e2a3fecaaafe7b47bb6f","t":[["52\/26\/5226aa6d0b073fc93d5d257749efdabb\/eng-0.vtt","English"],["52\/26\/5226aa6d0b073fc93d5d257749efdabb\/por-2.vtt","Portuguese"],["52\/26\/5226aa6d0b073fc93d5d257749efdabb\/spa-1.vtt","Spanish"]]}}}
