However, Kyouko was not always the wise and radiant person that she is fondly remembered as in the present day.\n\nFeeling deserted by her own family and rejected by society, a young Kyouko abandons stability for a life of delinquency, jeopardizing her education and future. Fortunately, her descent into despair is interrupted by a fateful encounter with her husband-to-be Katsuya, who has recently started his teaching internship at her school.\n\nWith a composure surprisingly unaffected by Kyouko's tantrums, Katsuya quickly wins her over through his gentleness and attention toward her\u2014sincere gestures that she has never received before.
