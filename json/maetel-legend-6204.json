Queen La Andromeda Prometheum decides that the only way for her people to survive is for them to submit to Hardgear's transformation process, which will turn everyone's body into machines. The Queen's daughters, Emeraldas and Maetel, refuse to submit to this process, and fight to stay human.","nm":"Maetel Legend","jp":"Maetel Legend","im":"https:\/\/img.bunnyccdn.co\/_r\/300x400\/100\/b2\/c5\/b2c594a7fe5b54cd8cdf844c7124b210\/b2c594a7fe5b54cd8cdf844c7124b210.jpg","tp":"OVA","fi":"Finished Airing","rt":"6.42","tm":45,"dt":"Dec 13, 2000 to Mar 7, 2001","ge":["Drama","Sci-Fi","Space"],"st":["Vega Entertainment"],"eps":{"1":{"i":[0,0,0,0],"f":"83c42fe7cd95e870dd87720c616f03330b38c405a1ab96fa2a9f43e12dd4737d1fc98507b1ec36c50dc708d235c2d19a2f4986f3b868e26be80ded082bd43e584f9cd25f82224b47d9a740299592e304d3ef5ff085dd0bbfe676f7074fb18f8a5ba512557d5cd662094c903604bbae88af19bef908de6968ad207980ccf3ffb2","t":[["60\/f5\/60f5f3fd43d30b3b8b1347b1738e17f3\/60f5f3fd43d30b3b8b1347b1738e17f3.vtt","English"]]}}}
