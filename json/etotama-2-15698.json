{"de":"The seemingly eternal cat-and-mouse battle has ended, and now everyone is living peacefully. One day, an Eto-musume (Zodiac girl) named Na-tan appears, to the puzzlement of the 12 signs, and to the unreserved delight of Nya-tan (whose spirits are always lifted by the pure, straightforward Na-tan). Meanwhile, Chu-tan also appears and warns of a looming disaster. \"The seal\u2026 has been broken.\" Who is this mysterious Eto-musume Na-tan? What in the world is the deity that has awoken beneath the seal?","nm":"Etotama 2","jp":"Etotama: Nyankyaku Banrai","im":"https:\/\/img.bunnyccdn.co\/_r\/300x400\/100\/7a\/46\/7a46bbd1bf796e754f713eb36e99110f\/7a46bbd1bf796e754f713eb36e99110f.jpg","tp":"ONA","fi":"Finished Airing","rt":"6.38","tm":28,"dt":"May 25, 2021","ge":["Action","Comedy","Fantasy"],"st":["Shirogumi"],"eps":{"1":{"i":[0,0,0,0],"f":"f7802c2c8255f7c8ae1955ad889f268de8e66b55ccb66e58c364943aa062660c1b826508163618a32ff0a993c259c4a6a801c6489c6e3397b76f0d639d4bd64a12f9be0d0db9a81737ad1bd67e234e5ceb15c0b6713e42c31711e44096d32a27fc2a4c6792f2f75cec74730840ac4318d322f42bf002b503d34084004625f1f6","t":[["47\/42\/474292a4e113192511d8f6dd8096f17a\/474292a4e113192511d8f6dd8096f17a.vtt","English"]]}}}
