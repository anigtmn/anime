{"de":"The first episode is a summary of SM, SM R and SM S, the second episode is about Haruka and Michiru on a cruise ship. They fight one of the SuperS enemies and decide to leave this villain to the classical Sailor Team. (That's an explanation why the outer Sailor Team doesn't appear in this season.) In episode 3 Chibiusa uncovers one of her classmates as a monster and fights her with the Sailor Team in a vampire castle.","nm":"Sailor Moon SuperS Specials","jp":"Bishoujo Senshi Sailor Moon SuperS Specials","im":"https:\/\/img.bunnyccdn.co\/_r\/300x400\/100\/d3\/15\/d315fe0dc9113c25afb4bf03d15e1278\/d315fe0dc9113c25afb4bf03d15e1278.jpg","tp":"Special","fi":"Finished Airing","rt":"7.38","tm":45,"dt":"Apr 8, 1995","ge":["Magic","Romance","Shoujo"],"st":["Toei Animation"],"eps":{"1":{"i":[0,0,0,0],"f":"f29895ec89b6b2260202befbdd9e04c887cf51b8b6b459245d4dd81347b6aac2017546f1c49175abbb7d7e90ef99070370cc690d3d1164c837b6ffee14875a644c1a5a99c758654451f0ea94e8b9368d75dbfbe8b3e731b37909fb6ba08c158e26cef8c2ee7d490c092b20c152735307d5572ba000ac1b1437b2e9e54f5ae5fe","t":[["e6\/2d\/e62da59876f331098e9bbc29fd1e0a50\/e62da59876f331098e9bbc29fd1e0a50.vtt","English"]]}}}
