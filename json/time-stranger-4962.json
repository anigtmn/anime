{"de":"Remy Shimoda is in a hurry. She's on her way to a reunion with the other members of the Go Shogun team, and she's late. A police action with some robbers gets in her way, so she runs the robbers off the road. Her vision blurs and she gets into an accident. The movie splits into two with one plot following Remy's slow decline at the hospital with the Go Shogun members and former enemies at her side, and her experience in a strange city where she, and the rest of the team have their deaths foretold. Remy, herself, is plagued by visions of her death, and visitations from a threatening girl and her panther-like cat. The temple at the center of the city is the key, so the team sets out to battle their way into it. Based on the giant robot series \"Go Shogun\", this is a story focusing on Remy, the female member of the team.","nm":"Time Stranger","jp":"Sengoku Majin Goushougun: Toki no Etranger","im":"https:\/\/img.bunnyccdn.co\/_r\/300x400\/100\/09\/15\/09156f8cc99d3c91f3e5d5fa158f3568\/09156f8cc99d3c91f3e5d5fa158f3568.jpg","tp":"Movie","fi":"Finished Airing","rt":"6.67","tm":88,"dt":"Apr 27, 1985","ge":["Action","Sci-Fi"],"st":["Production Reed"],"eps":{"1":{"i":[0,0,0,0],"f":"8a4047004c32aff879e793955568209f34fe1d86f467e0cd5f6e1c6f4ad4b9d52fcb58c6a1d5248f8f81b0aa3b4ffd26b624a9b3da18f8c48dcfbd75ae842d2c74270fdbd8be0e9ce6255195ef09f4af5341469fdca2e790ea7b3dbf92f613379384e99aeb0281775410e1494aa8e1fbdf10c0b2e34bb2aed8d09dde970b5579","t":[["a4\/76\/a47648a942237c782c644b0bf222b6af\/a47648a942237c782c644b0bf222b6af.vtt","English"]]}}}
