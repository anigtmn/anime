{"de":"Even during summer break, the Amusement Club lives up to its name! When Akari Akaza, Kyouko Toshinou, Chinatsu Yoshikawa, and Yui Funami find a camping tent, they decide to put it to good use by spending the weekend outside in the mountains. When some student council members catch wind of this, they are invited to come along as well.\n\nAfter a very long journey, the group arrives at their destination and is ready to make the most of their trip. They engage in classic camping activities, such as outdoor cooking and tests of courage, and finish it all off with a visit to the hot springs. An extravagant trip like this doesn't happen every day, but the Amusement Club is sure to savor each moment.","nm":"Yuru Yuri Summer Vacation!","jp":"Yuru Yuri Nachuyachumi!","im":"https:\/\/img.bunnyccdn.co\/_r\/300x400\/100\/14\/cb\/14cb97350d98e2190c57c91288a3e41f\/14cb97350d98e2190c57c91288a3e41f.jpg","tp":"OVA","fi":"Finished Airing","rt":"7.89","tm":63,"dt":"Feb 18, 2015","ge":["Comedy","Shoujo Ai","Slice of Life"],"st":["TYO Animations"],"eps":{"1":{"i":[0,0,0,0],"f":"e26171ed0aa52eb609620a8dfd7ab29393ba27bdfea2bde606522ee9166d5776bc36687275dbb0a8a029b927f15a7026d1101cf89cf0a487f846a5693b5adf5920404938e7112d451c4146d1b4d42c8bcfa93c26482afd1dc121ad961f5cbe51fc1edfaea4f14cf0171345fcfece63f94519e548667342eb21f430658a4ca25a","t":[["cf\/2b\/cf2b705c131423a94fd8757e12e4d3c6\/cf2b705c131423a94fd8757e12e4d3c6.vtt","English"]]}}}
