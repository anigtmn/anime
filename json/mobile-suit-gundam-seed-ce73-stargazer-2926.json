{"de":"In C.E. 73, tensions between Naturals and Coordinators continue to persist, eventually leading to another war between the Earth Alliance and PLANT. Sven Cal Bayan is a Natural pilot of the elite EA squad, the Phantom Pain, and carries out his squad's various anti-Coordinator missions without fail. Selene McGriff is a Coordinator researcher at the neutral Deep Space Survey and Development Organization (DSSD) and a developer of the GSX-401FW Stargazer space exploration mobile suit. Though their backgrounds are completely different, the expanding war will nevertheless force their paths to collide.\n\n(Source: ANN)","nm":"Mobile Suit Gundam SEED C.E.73: Stargazer","jp":"Mobile Suit Gundam SEED C.E.73: Stargazer","im":"https:\/\/img.bunnyccdn.co\/_r\/300x400\/100\/bc\/7e\/bc7e76c670b938c442b648cffa774571\/bc7e76c670b938c442b648cffa774571.jpg","tp":"ONA","fi":"Finished Airing","rt":"7.16","tm":15,"dt":"Jul 14, 2006 to Sep 29, 2006","ge":["Mecha","Sci-Fi","Space","Military"],"st":["Sunrise"],"eps":{"1":{"i":[0,0,0,0],"f":"c140f2346982db4f74d19200e22e29fe9d3fa8f17f40edf63d3ed2c2a96b80042f9887aafe24dfece93ef84a936805fcc7944b5bcec4e0480e26c73909d6ca8845f1ed4dfb169159b29865a731ba315996dde149cca25410200ca97d3282c414b444d5aa6dee2640accf8125a1d400f3","t":[["18\/c9\/18c936d08076055811ea16757961761b\/eng-3.vtt","English"]]}}}
