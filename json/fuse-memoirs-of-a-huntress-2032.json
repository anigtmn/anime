{"de":"In Kyokutei Bakin's classic Japanese epic novel Nansou Satomi Hakkenden, eight samurai serve the Satomi clan during Japan's tumultuous Sengoku (Warring States) era. The Edo-era samurai are the reincarnations of the spirits that Princess Fuse mothered with a dog named Yatsufusa. In Fuse Gansaku: Satomi Hakkenden, the female hunter Hamaji comes to her brother in order to hunt Fuse. Thus, the karmic cycle of retribution that began long ago with the Satomi family begins anew.","nm":"Fus\u00e9: Memoirs of a Huntress","jp":"Fuse: Teppou Musume no Torimonochou","im":"https:\/\/img.bunnyccdn.co\/_r\/300x400\/100\/55\/fc\/55fc96d8bdb248221e9f27f9d01a668a\/55fc96d8bdb248221e9f27f9d01a668a.jpg","tp":"Movie","fi":"Finished Airing","rt":"7.36","tm":110,"dt":"Oct 20, 2012","ge":["Action","Drama","Historical","Supernatural"],"st":["TMS Entertainment"],"eps":{"1":{"i":[0,0,0,0],"f":"4391122c7ee09b878c7c092744e131d7db9a8cc4f6918dd42819820ff2e156e75279ec09c3b6c2dad142578f3640042ec39576646dad5b870568d856e6222fa1e600d9bfdf8193eb531bb5e76562bdaeb7397367e51bf5721ab5c81d03678bd781bd8fd565d8de3da07bbd28a448ad255a360085c38cbc60a672929445a1e0b0","t":[["28\/99\/2899205a27fbd47cc450f53d064dc4c9\/2899205a27fbd47cc450f53d064dc4c9.vtt","English"]]}}}
