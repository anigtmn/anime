{"de":"This special is a set of short comedy stories involving Gintoki and his equally-broke sidekicks Shinpachi and Kagura. One day, Gintoki and his comrades are out viewing the spring flowers when suddenly the Shinsengumi appear, arguing that Gintoki has taken their flower-viewing spot. Gintoki's team and the Shinsengumi must then battle for the right to sit in that spot by using a violent version of rock paper scissors.","nm":"Gintama: Nanigoto mo Saiyo ga Kanjin nano de Tasho Senobisuru Kurai ga Choudoyoi","jp":"Gintama: Nanigoto mo Saiyo ga Kanjin nano de Tasho Senobisuru Kurai ga Choudoyoi","im":"https:\/\/img.bunnyccdn.co\/_r\/300x400\/100\/4e\/31\/4e314b4c312604128ab6ceecac3546a1\/4e314b4c312604128ab6ceecac3546a1.jpg","tp":"Special","fi":"Finished Airing","rt":"8.08","tm":32,"dt":"Sep 24, 2005","ge":["Action","Comedy","Historical","Mecha","Parody","Samurai","Sci-Fi","Shounen"],"st":["Sunrise"],"eps":{"1":{"i":[0,0,0,0],"f":"43645c46a0a943298bb97ad188d8c5d86850ee521af72eac7fba094cd9f40e990574d0bec05e5f1f3c8722254d731ebf8b49e79f3f3cb234f8c5669fa15c907a1e6472d4215c7a01486b2f1a5ad8f46303dd620df45dc01d17ff0f87163375a7ea777ae985193c08f0a35bcf05246210f93f5fa1d5579f94dab2b857fad21a8b","t":[["0a\/52\/0a524fcd992a11d04b2e7b2a57e0547f\/0a524fcd992a11d04b2e7b2a57e0547f.vtt","English"]]}}}
