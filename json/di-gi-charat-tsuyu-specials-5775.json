{"de":"Di Gi Charat (call her Dejiko for short) and Petit Charat (the cute little charat) come down to Earth, where they want to be idols, or something like that. Rabi~en~Rose (a random girl with bunny ears) decides they're in her way of becoming an idol herself. They all end up working at Gamers, where various otaku, children, and humanoid fingers walk in and act like morons.\n\nContains:\nGema no Sumika\nTsusode shiu Engekidan (ii ne!)\n\n(Source: AniDB)","nm":"Di Gi Charat Tsuyu Specials","jp":"Di Gi Charat Tsuyu Specials","im":"https:\/\/img.bunnyccdn.co\/_r\/300x400\/100\/ad\/bf\/adbf75294b930d8c817216dc82258600\/adbf75294b930d8c817216dc82258600.jpg","tp":"Special","fi":"Finished Airing","rt":"6.49","tm":12,"dt":"Jun 1, 2001","ge":["Comedy"],"st":["Madhouse"],"eps":{"1":{"i":[0,0,0,0],"f":"55ba83fbd58ce32bbe0bd911be6f9af62691142a2f4e67481461e3810daf23fdd52b6a5a6ea084e1c195523da9dc4c355f44be9ffdb43abf18e931537b7b16b8db65de2f4319681759ddb1e489997bd7f548d45231e78c3cd79abe39862243287ddfecda77e0e5344d7731bcbfa209bb","t":[["68\/c3\/68c3f580cfdc0ca399ea82226642b0c7\/68c3f580cfdc0ca399ea82226642b0c7.vtt","English"]]},"2":{"i":[0,0,0,0],"f":"164799e13d19cd1be7274e75cc1227075f5bfe291e58d82e87c614ea572bca30e35ce69388345ecf9df42f690dc4ac7f780d5db0e416b07eb43485c4daa98b0dbe68f22d133cb118f232ec72a7219d90a5ee1ea13996343f1d08d5ecd00ff0983b01bc4cbce4bce3213996c3202ab561","t":[["71\/a9\/71a97bb58f851cfaf110e3a75e2717a3\/71a97bb58f851cfaf110e3a75e2717a3.vtt","English"]]}}}
