Racers are pushed to their absolute limit\u2014a feeling that daredevil driver JP knows all too well. Having just qualified to participate in Redline, he is eager to battle against the other highly skilled drivers, particularly the beautiful rising star and the only other human that qualified, Sonoshee McLaren.\n\nBut this year's Redline may be far more dangerous than usual\u2014it has been announced to take place on the planet Roboworld with its trigger-happy military and criminals who look to turn the race to their own advantage.
