{"de":"Hyoudo Riki is just an ordinary guy who likes to wear a tiger mask while Kung-Fu fighting, which means he fits in real well at BATTLE ROYAL HIGH SCHOOL!\n\nUnfortunately for Riki, he`s the doppleganger in our world of Byoudo, Master of the Dark Realm, and when a dimensional gate opens between the two worlds, the evil Fairy Master tricks Byoudo  into making an attempt to conquer our beautiful, and better lit, world.\n\nNow poor Riki is semi-possessed by his opposite number, and the minions of the Fairy Master are mutating his classmates into hideous lustful monsters. To make matters worse, all the inter-dimensional commotion has attracted the attention of a sword-happy exorcist and the heroic Zankan of the Space-Time Police!\n\nWhich all means that Riki is about to take one bitch of a mid-term. The course is survival, and forget \"Pass\/Fail\". The test is graded \"Live\/Die\".","nm":"Battle Royal High School","jp":"Battle Royal High School","im":"https:\/\/img.bunnyccdn.co\/_r\/300x400\/100\/7e\/6a\/7e6accc5815911de35f5996d239dd8df\/7e6accc5815911de35f5996d239dd8df.jpg","tp":"OVA","fi":"Finished Airing","rt":"5.58","tm":59,"dt":"Dec 10, 1987","ge":["Action","Demons","Horror","Martial Arts","Super Power","Supernatural"],"st":["AIC"],"eps":{"1":{"i":[0,0,0,0],"f":"abf4cbe31e1a5afa47ce43c448e18f081156584d423d152547643b22fec801613a47d3f7c9b83539feeb74d87dce8f4fe89378aa647636c0c5668ba3c5fe29b80505bdb194382aa506593c838cda45f10240fadb21715c675ea9991c06bac62ed74a0837b5df118b8e169d6abfb386a7ac6e4f6901fb9ee3e25209d486edee3e","t":[["83\/33\/8333a4d39fbb0da373688e20474521d9\/8333a4d39fbb0da373688e20474521d9.vtt","English"]]}}}
