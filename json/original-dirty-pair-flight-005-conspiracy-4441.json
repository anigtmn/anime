The Lovely Angels are back on the job, but this time the 3WA's Central Computer has assigned them two cases at the same time: investigate a space liner explosion in which three hundred people died, but no one`s come forward to claim any insurance money; and find a missing scientist and his family.\n\nCould the two cases be connected? Only the Central Computer knows and it's not talking. So it's up the Dirty Pair to get down and dirty and solve the puzzle before time runs out for a grieving grandfather, his family and the universe!\n\n(Source: AniDB)","nm":"Original Dirty Pair: Flight 005 Conspiracy","jp":"Dirty Pair: Bouryaku no 005-bin","im":"https:\/\/img.bunnyccdn.co\/_r\/300x400\/100\/cb\/5c\/cb5c14751c962efd06b24db5016cfd5d\/cb5c14751c962efd06b24db5016cfd5d.jpg","tp":"OVA","fi":"Finished Airing","rt":"6.79","tm":59,"dt":"Jan 25, 1990","ge":["Action","Adventure","Comedy","Sci-Fi","Police"],"st":["Sunrise"],"eps":{"1":{"i":[0,0,0,0],"f":"ca9d6c189e20b5cc3549a26d8a9194528d97d4af26c95ca29ea16b52c73518a2ed8e21217869edfcbc03497854b5818f455c419be0589424631cb38ab1ef2ab2b67202c1a91287b94532e1fccb4e0322fe2738d27b1c46dfde1785d0223a41d529c16bb312714d71e048b1aacffe5391d3846d7c8c7181dcc8bd82229a79e8d5","t":[["70\/5b\/705be161ad884f984fbc7bb6e6a8754d\/eng-2.vtt","English"]]}}}
