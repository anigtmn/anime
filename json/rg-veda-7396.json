{"de":"The fearsome warrior Taishaku-ten rebelled against the world-ruling gods three hundred years ago and began his own oppressive reign. His dominion remained unchecked for years\u2014until one day, the blind prophet Kuyou prophesied that warriors known as the Six Stars and a child of the vanished race called Ashura would defeat Taishaku-ten. \n\nAshura, marked by his pointed ears and golden eyes; Yasha-ou, a robust warrior; and four other Stars prepare to challenge Taishaku-ten. In order to do so, they must journey across tarnished landscapes and battle monstrous demons that have plagued the land. But as the wheels of fate turn, Ashura and Yasha-ou must find the sixth Star before it is too late.","nm":"RG Veda","jp":"RG Veda","im":"https:\/\/img.bunnyccdn.co\/_r\/300x400\/100\/38\/93\/38938de4bc63d9ee4277915f7901dd48\/38938de4bc63d9ee4277915f7901dd48.jpg","tp":"OVA","fi":"Finished Airing","rt":"6.15","tm":43,"dt":"Jun 1, 1991 to Jun 21, 1992","ge":["Adventure","Drama","Fantasy"],"st":["animate Film"],"eps":{"1":{"i":[0,0,0,0],"f":"0a4a335cb30ffc501590fa0b5817febedcb117770d62b49209e0b8378099aec9055d39f3ff5482c5a142d3d29547064c9f96fc3f5eb60b169700a571e4feeff28aea69d52c9fc449a79ed1fde954f47559d8107d1dea5ab9673c9d6c7f22adc5144c93e8b7cfa6b77165217848e1c7572d3af3a07be65eb4153d306413d1bba8","t":[["ed\/13\/ed1353ce7ac3165eadf9e9f922d5206e\/ed1353ce7ac3165eadf9e9f922d5206e.vtt","English"]]},"2":{"i":[0,0,0,0],"f":"9f3a90ea46acfdfc29595e7c3ab8eeeb6aa759a1349af269f702a98592e64983111afc1658b2102bb1fb3f41658bcdc2899a056920fdd50a0693e67767d8f40bec6a87084a77e2761b410debe7f0ec6c35b2db2a46752437e82ce409bbd1ae987fedb2ad242670fcf9170bb7d8c01f0e94b2c09598cee2223c0cda227dd639eb","t":[["d8\/54\/d854ea4ec43b3f8494d2a6f7f5db64f9\/d854ea4ec43b3f8494d2a6f7f5db64f9.vtt","English"]]}}}
